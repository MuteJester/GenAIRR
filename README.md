# GenAIRR: AIRR Sequence Simulator

GenAIRR is a Python module designed to generate synthetic Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) sequences for the purpose of benchmarking alignment algorithms and conducting sequence analysis in a non-biased manner.


- **Realistic Sequence Simulation**: Generate heavy and light immunoglobulin chain sequences with extensive customization options.
- **Advanced Mutation and Augmentation**: Introduce mutations and augment sequences to closely mimic the natural diversity and sequencing artifacts.
- **Precision in Allele-Specific Corrections**: Utilize sophisticated correction maps to accurately handle allele-specific trimming events and ambiguities.
- **Indel Simulation Capability**: Reflect the intricacies of sequencing data by simulating insertions and deletions within sequences.

## Installation

```bash
pip install GenAIRR
```

Please ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system before installing GenAIRR using the pip command above.

# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and their solutions when using GenAIRR.

## Common Errors

### 1. "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute..."

**Problem**: DataConfig not set before running pipeline steps.

**Solution**: Always call `AugmentationStep.set_dataconfig()` before creating pipelines:
```python
from GenAIRR.steps.StepBase import AugmentationStep
from GenAIRR.data import HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB

# ALWAYS do this first
AugmentationStep.set_dataconfig(HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB)

# Then create your pipeline
pipeline = AugmentationPipeline([...])
```

### 2. "No functional sequences generated"

**Problem**: All generated sequences have stop codons or are out-of-frame.

**Solutions**:
- Set `productive=True` in SimulateSequence
- Lower your mutation rates
- Check your data configuration has functional alleles

```python
# Use productive sequences
SimulateSequence(S5F(0.003, 0.25), productive=True)
```

### 3. "Empty mutations dictionary"

**Problem**: Using Uniform(0, 0) or very low mutation rates.

**Solution**: Increase mutation rates or use S5F for realistic mutations:
```python
# Instead of this (no mutations)
SimulateSequence(Uniform(0, 0), True)

# Use this for naive sequences with potential for mutations
SimulateSequence(S5F(0.001, 0.01), True)
```

### 4. "Allele not found in data config"

**Problem**: Trying to use specific alleles that don't exist in your DataConfig.

**Solution**: Check available alleles first:
```python
# List available V alleles
print(list(HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB.v_alleles.keys()))

# Access specific allele properly
v_allele = HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB.v_alleles['IGHV1-2*02'][0]
```

### 5. "Pipeline execution is very slow"

**Potential causes and solutions**:
- **High mutation rates**: Lower max_mutation_rate
- **Complex pipelines**: Remove unnecessary steps
- **Productive=True with high mutation rates**: The library keeps retrying until finding functional sequences

```python
# Faster execution
SimulateSequence(S5F(0.003, 0.05), True)  # Lower max rate
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Usage
- Generate sequences in batches rather than all at once
- Use `get_dict()` only when needed (it creates copies)

### Speed Tips
- Use built-in data configs (they're pre-optimized)
- Avoid very high mutation rates (>0.3) unless necessary
- Set reasonable max_sequence_length values

## Debugging Tips

### Check Your Pipeline
```python
# Print pipeline structure
for i, step in enumerate(pipeline.steps):
    print(f"Step {i}: {type(step).__name__}")
```

### Inspect Container State
```python
# After each step
container = pipeline.execute()
print("Sequence length:", len(container.sequence))
print("Mutations count:", len(container.mutations))
print("Is productive:", container.productive)
```

### Validate Data Config
```python
# Check if data config is loaded
print("V alleles count:", len(HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB.v_alleles))
print("Chain type:", HUMAN_IGH_OGRDB.metadata.chain_type)
```
